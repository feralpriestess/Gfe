### How to add themes
#### How to add themes to your LinkStack instance
You can add your downloaded themes to your LinkStack instance on the Admin Panel. Navigate to the 'Themes' tab and scroll to the bottom of the page.

Now click on Choose file and select your downloaded theme zip file. Now click on 'Upload theme' and you should be able to select your uploaded theme now.

<br><br>

### **Themes are envisioned to be made by users for users.**

If you know a bit about CSS, consider making your own theme and adding it to the public directory.
Everything is documented in the dedicated GitHub repository.

<a name="Updating"></a>
## Updating

When a **new version** is released, you will get an update notification on your Admin Panel.

### Automatic one click Updater
This updater allows you to update your installation with just one click.

<br>	

**How to use the Automatic Updater:**

- To update your instance, click on the update notification on your Admin Panel.

- Click on ‚ÄúUpdate automatically‚Äù and the updater will take care of the rest.

You can still download updates manually. New versions will are still uploaded to the GitHub repository as usual.

<br>	

Before updating, the updater will create a backup. Your instance won‚Äôt save more than two backups at a time. You can download these updates from the created folder: `backups\updater-backups`.

If you switched your database to MySQL, your database will not be included in the backup.
